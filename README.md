## Module3 Challenge - Written Report

### Affects and changes are based on the dropped math and reading scores for Thomas HS

- Average math and reading scores for the district were not affected by much due to the dropped Thomas scores.  Math averages dropped from 79.0% to 78.9% and reading averages remained at 81.9%.  Overall passing percentage remained at 65%

- The specific numbers for Thomas High School saw a more dramatic downturn on results based on the dropped scores from the 9th graders than what was seen across the district.  The more significant change to summary numbers is due to only 1635 total students at the high school, as opposed to using the total from all schools.

- Replacing the 9th grade scores negatively affects all other aspects of the schools relative performance.  Thomas High School is no longer #2 ranked behing Cabrera but did not drop to the bottom out of 15 schools.
